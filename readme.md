# Website: Personal Portfolio

## Project Information

### About

This is a personal project portfolio showcasing work I have completed in Android Development, Front End Development, and other various areas. At the bottom of the page, you may find my contact information as well as a current resume if you are interested in knowing a bit more about me. 

## User Interface

I decided to implement a consistent white, black, and blue color scheme throughout the site to develop a professional theme and conssitency. Projects were broken up by category and palced in their own section of the page. I broke various sections of the site by what I call "fun quotes," the black banners with various quotes about my personality and motivation.
